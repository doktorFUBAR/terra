# Terra - science museum :telescope:

## Project Brief
This was an early HTML/CSS project I did through school.
I was asked to make a website for a science museum with kids/youth/families as the target audience.

## End result
This website works mostly as intended; it's informative and responsive.
There are some design related things I would have changed if I redid the website today.

I've later come back to the project and added some really basic JavaScript. It was included in my year 1 portfolio in school.
